### Code Contributions

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Write or update tests as needed
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
7. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
8. Open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Git

### Local Development Environment

1. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hyper.git
   cd hyper/packages/dancycodes/hyper
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Run tests to verify setup:**
   ```bash
   composer test
   ```

4. **Make your changes** in the `src/` directory

5. **Write tests** for your changes in the `tests/` directory

6. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   composer test
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run only unit tests
composer test-unit

# Run only feature tests
composer test-feature

# Generate coverage report
composer test-coverage
```

### Coding Standards

We follow the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standard and use PHP CS Fixer to enforce it.

```bash
# Check code style
./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run --diff

# Fix code style automatically
./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix
```

**Key Guidelines:**

- Use type hints for all method parameters and return types
- Add PHPDoc blocks for all public methods
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Use descriptive variable and method names
- Follow Laravel naming conventions
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names

**Example:**

```php
/**
 * Update signals and return Hyper response.
 *
 * @param  array<string, mixed>  $signals
 * @return $this
 */
public function signals(array $signals): self
{
    foreach ($signals as $key => $value) {
        $this->updateSignal($key, $value);
    }

    return $this;
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests** (`tests/Unit/`): Test individual classes and methods in isolation
- **Feature Tests** (`tests/Feature/`): Test complete workflows and integrations

### Writing Tests

1. **Use descriptive test names:**
   ```php
   public function test_signals_method_updates_multiple_signals_correctly()
   ```

2. **Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:**
   ```php
   public function test_example()
   {
       // Arrange
       $user = User::factory()->create();

       // Act
       $response = hyper()->signals(['user' => $user]);

       // Assert
       $this->assertInstanceOf(HyperResponse::class, $response);
   }
   ```

3. **Test edge cases and error conditions:**
   - Invalid input
   - Empty data
   - Null values
   - Boundary conditions

4. **Mock external dependencies:**
   ```php
   $mock = Mockery::mock(HyperFileStorage::class);
   $mock->shouldReceive('store')->once()->andReturn('path/to/file');
   ```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for **95%+ code coverage**
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
