/**
 * Locked Signal Tampering Security Exception
 *
 * Exception thrown when locked signal tampering is detected during request processing.
 * Occurs when client-modified locked signal values fail cryptographic signature verification,
 * when locked signal values differ from server-stored encrypted session values, or when
 * unexpected locked signals appear in request that were not present during initialization.
 *
 * Locked signals use underscore suffix naming convention to mark server-controlled values
 * protected from client modification through encrypted session storage and hash verification.
 * Tampering detection prevents unauthorized modification of security-sensitive state like
 * user permissions, role identifiers, or resource ownership flags.
 *
 * Exception handling includes automatic security logging with user context, conditional
 * response rendering based on request type, and configurable violation reporting through
 * Laravel logging system. Hyper requests receive reactive error responses with signals
 * update, JSON requests receive structured error payload, traditional requests redirect
 * with validation error messages.
 *
 * @see \Dancycodes\Hyper\Http\HyperSignal::validateLockedSignals()
 * @see \Dancycodes\Hyper\Http\HyperSignal::storeLockedSignals()
